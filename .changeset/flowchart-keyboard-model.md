Reworked flowchart keyboard model. Arrow-key bindings are reworked and disambiguated by modifier: `Arrow` nudges (unchanged); `Cmd/Ctrl+Arrow` grows a flowchart CREATE session (each press adds a pending connected sibling, previewed on the overlay, committed as one undo step when Cmd/Ctrl is released, cancelled on Escape); `Alt+Arrow` navigates to the adjacent node (graph neighbour, else spatially nearest); `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` aligns (moved off the old plain `Alt+Arrow`). The old `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Arrow` spawn binding is retired.

New API: `editor.growFlowchart` / `commitFlowchart` / `cancelFlowchart` / `navigateFlowchart` / `flowchartPreview`, the pure `computeSpawnConnectedNodes`, and `endpointElementId` (scene). `<Diagram>` wires the keyup-commit / Escape-cancel lifecycle for you.
