New package `@oh-just-another/fonts` bundles the editor's fonts (Roboto, PT Serif, Roboto Mono) as web fonts, and the Canvas2D / offscreen backends now draw with them via `resolveBundledFamily`. Text is consistent across renderers instead of WebGL2 using the embedded font while Canvas2D fell back to a system font. `<Editor>` loads the fonts on mount and redraws once they're ready.
