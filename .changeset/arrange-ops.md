Arrange operations for the selection. **Flip** mirrors the selection about its bounding-box centre — horizontal (`Shift+H`) and vertical (`Shift+V`); a single shape flips about its own centre. **Align** flushes two or more shapes to the left / right / top / bottom edge or the horizontal / vertical centre of their bounding box (`Alt+←/→/↑/↓` for the four edges; centres via the panel / menu). **Distribute** evenly spaces three or more shapes so the gaps between them are equal, on the horizontal (`Alt+H`) or vertical (`Alt+V`) axis, keeping the outermost shapes fixed. All three are available from the selection property panel and the right-click menu. New engine API: `Editor.flipSelection(axis)`, `Editor.alignSelection(edge)`, and `Editor.distributeSelection(axis)`.
