# @oh-just-another/scene

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- 9673846: Grid model rework. The viewport's `gridSize` (spacing that doubled as a hidden/
  shown toggle) is replaced by an explicit `gridEnabled` boolean; spacing is fixed
  at `DEFAULT_GRID_SPACING`. The runtime `gridVisible` flag is removed — grid
  on/off now lives on the scene viewport and persists with it. Scene documents
  migrate v1 → v2 automatically (`gridSize > 0` → `gridEnabled: true`). `<Editor>`
  ships gridless by default; hosts enable the grid per scene.
- f98730f: Removed the unused `allElementsInLayer` export. Build the same list with `getElementsInLayer(scene, layerId).map((s) => s.id)`.
- 904cc09: Export `FALLBACK_SCENE_WIDTH` / `FALLBACK_SCENE_HEIGHT` — the default canvas dimensions for a scene with no explicit viewport size. Shared by the import and export adapters.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- d1b96d9: Couple snap-to-grid to grid visibility, and turn the grid on by default.

  Snapping is now active only while a grid is actually displayed — the toggle is
  on (`gridVisible`) AND the scene has a positive `gridSize`, the same condition
  `renderGrid` paints under. Snapping to an invisible grid is gone: no grid → no
  snap, always.

  `DEFAULT_VIEWPORT` now ships `gridSize: DEFAULT_GRID_SPACING` (tune it in scene
  `constants.ts`), so a fresh scene has a visible grid and snapping on. Pass a
  scene with `gridSize: 0` (or omit it on a custom viewport) for a gridless,
  snap-free canvas.
