# @oh-just-another/serialization

## 0.60.0

### Minor Changes

- 762dd8a: Brush capture pipeline upgrade: input streamlining (low-pass with commit-time catch-up), speed-simulated pressure for mouse/touch (slow = thick, fast = thin) with rate-limited pen pressure, sample decimation with a soft point cap, and end tapering. `BrushElement` gains an optional regeneration payload (`pressures`, `simulatePressure`, `baseWidth`) carried through serialization; `Editor.beginBrushStroke` accepts a `pointerType` argument to pick the pressure source. The live preview runs the same pipeline as the commit.

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- 783749e: Brush strokes can now be closed and filled. When a fill colour is set in the drawing panel and a stroke's end is drawn back near its start (within `BRUSH_CLOSE_DISTANCE`), the committed `BrushElement` gets `closed: true` and the renderer fills the enclosed area with `style.fill` under the variable-width stroke body. Open strokes and strokes drawn without a fill colour are unchanged. `BrushElement.closed` is serialized.
- bdc847e: Add four editor tools:
  - **Eyedropper** — new `eyedropper` mode (toolbar button, `Alt+I`). Click a
    shape to sample its fill/stroke and apply it to the selection.
    `Editor.pickColorAt` / `applyEyedropperAt` + pure `pickColorAt`.
  - **Convert element type** — `Editor.convertSelection(target)` and pure
    `computeConvertType` switch rectangle ↔ ellipse ↔ diamond (polygon) in place,
    preserving position/size/style. New "Shape type" property-panel control.
  - **Image crop** — optional normalised `crop` rect on `ImageElement` (additive,
    serialised). New `crop` mode entered by double-clicking an image or the
    property-panel Crop button: drag a frame, `Enter` to apply, `Esc` to cancel.
    Canvas2D renders the cropped source region (`RenderTarget.drawImage` gains an
    optional `crop` arg). `Editor.beginImageCrop` / `commitImageCrop` /
    `cancelImageCrop` + pure `computeSetImageCrop` / `cropRectFromWorldDrag`.
  - **Flowchart auto-generate** — `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Arrow` spawns a connected node
    from the selected node in that direction. `Editor.spawnConnectedNode` + pure
    `computeSpawnConnectedNode`.

  Also exposes `worldToLocal` from `@oh-just-another/scene`.

- 672b557: Add `sceneJsonSchema()` — JSON Schema (draft-07) of the scene wire document, generated on the fly from the zod schema. For LLM structured output and external validators.
- cf8b735: Add styled text runs (rich text, phase 1): a `TextElement` can now carry an optional `runs` overlay — contiguous substrings each with a partial `TextStyle` (bold / italic / colour / decoration) over the element's base style. The flat `text` stays the source of truth (`runs.map(r => r.text).join("") === text`), so plain-text scenes render, serialise and round-trip byte-for-byte unchanged.
  - `scene`: `TextRun` type + `TextElement.runs?`; pure helpers `runsToText`, `normalizeRuns`, `sliceRuns`, and `applyStyleToRange(el, from, to, partial)` (splits/merges/coalesces runs, sheds the overlay when uniform).
  - `serialization`: additive optional `runs` in the text schema; legacy documents (no `runs`) round-trip unchanged.
  - `renderer-core`: the text renderer draws each visual line's style segments with per-run font + fill through the shared `RenderTarget`, so Canvas2D, WebGL2 and SVG all honour runs. Line breaking still uses the element's base metrics.
  - `state`: `Editor.applyTextStyleToRange(id, from, to, partial)` applies a style to a character range as one undo step.
  - `react-ui`: the text formatting controls (bold / italic / underline / strikethrough / colour) target the current inline-edit selection when one is active — styling just those characters — and fall back to whole-element styling otherwise.

  Full inline rich-text editing (per-run wrap metrics, caret-aware run editing) is a follow-up.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- 9673846: Grid model rework. The viewport's `gridSize` (spacing that doubled as a hidden/
  shown toggle) is replaced by an explicit `gridEnabled` boolean; spacing is fixed
  at `DEFAULT_GRID_SPACING`. The runtime `gridVisible` flag is removed — grid
  on/off now lives on the scene viewport and persists with it. Scene documents
  migrate v1 → v2 automatically (`gridSize > 0` → `gridEnabled: true`). `<Editor>`
  ships gridless by default; hosts enable the grid per scene.

### Patch Changes

- d44348a: Mark `migrations-builtin` as having side effects so tree-shaking bundlers keep the built-in scene migrations. Previously a `sideEffects: false` package flag let aggressive bundlers drop the migration registration, so an older scene document wouldn't upgrade on load.
